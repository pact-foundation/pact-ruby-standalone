      [--sslkey=SSLKEY]                    # Specify the path to the SSL key to use when running the service over HTTPS

Description:
  Start a stub service with the given pact file(s) or directories. Pact URIs may be local file or directory paths, or HTTP. Include any basic auth details in the
  URL using the format https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@URI. Where multiple matching interactions are found, the interactions will be sorted by response status, and the
  first one will be returned. This may lead to some non-deterministic behaviour. If you are having problems with this, please raise it on the pact-dev google
  group, and we can discuss some potential enhancements. Note that only versions 1 and 2 of the pact specification are currently fully supported. Pacts using the
  v3 format may be used, however, any matching features added in v3 will currently be ignored.

Description:
  The parameters used when fetching pacts dynamically from a Pact Broker are:
  
  --pact-broker-base-url (REQUIRED)
  --provider (REQUIRED)
  --broker-username/--broker-password or --broker-token
  --consumer-version-tag or --consumer-version-selector
  --enable-pending
  --include-wip-pacts-since
  
  To verify a pact at a known URL (eg. when a verification is triggered by a 'contract
  content changed' webhook), pass in the pact URL(s) as the first argument(s) to the command, and do NOT set any of the other parameters apart from the base URL
  and credentials.
  
  To publish verification results for either of the above scenarios, set:
  
  --publish-verification-results (REQUIRED)
  --provider-app-version (REQUIRED)
  --provider-version-tag or --tag-with-git-branch
  
  
  Selectors: These are specified using JSON strings. The keys are 'tag' (the name of the consumer version tag), 'latest' (true|false),
  'consumer', and 'fallbackTag'. For example '{\"tag\": \"master\", \"latest\": true}'. For a detailed explanation of selectors, see https://pact.io/selectors#consumer-version-selectors

A specific version can be ignored by also specifying a --version after the pacticipant name option.

Can also be enabled by setting the environment variable PACT_BROKER_CAN_I_DEPLOY_DRY_RUN=true. This mode is useful when setting up your CI/CD pipeline for the first time, or in a 'break glass' situation where you need to knowingly deploy what Pact considers a breaking change. For the second scenario, it is recommended to use the environment variable and just set it for the build required to deploy that particular version, so you don't accidentally leave the dry run mode enabled.
                                                                 # Default: false

Description:
  Returns exit code 0 or 1, indicating whether or not the specified application (pacticipant) has a successful verification result with each of the application
  versions that are already deployed to a particular environment. Prints out the relevant pact/verification details, indicating any missing or failed verification
  results.

  The can-i-deploy tool was originally written to support specifying versions and dependencies using tags. This usage has now been superseded by first class
  support for environments, deployments and releases. For documentation on how to use can-i-deploy with tags, please see
  https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/client_cli/can_i_deploy_usage_with_tags/

  Before `can-i-deploy` can be used, the relevant environment resources must first be created in the Pact Broker using the `create-environment` command. The
  "test" and "production" environments will have been seeded for you. You can check the existing environments by running `pact-broker list-environments`. See
  https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/client_cli/readme#environments for more information.

  $ pact-broker create-environment --name "uat" --display-name "UAT" --no-production

  After an application is deployed or released, its deployment must be recorded using the `record-deployment` or `record-release` commands. See
  https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/recording_deployments_and_releases/ for more information.

  $ pact-broker record-deployment --pacticipant Foo --version 173153ae0 --environment uat

  Before an application is deployed or released to an environment, the can-i-deploy command must be run to check that the application version is safe to deploy
  with the versions of each integrated application that are already in that environment.

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT --version VERSION --to-environment ENVIRONMENT

  Example: can I deploy version 173153ae0 of application Foo to the test environment?

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant Foo --version 173153ae0 --to-environment test

  Can-i-deploy can also be used to check if arbitrary versions have a successful verification. When asking "Can I deploy this application version with the latest
  version from the main branch of another application" it functions as a "can I merge" check.

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant Foo 173153ae0 \ --pacticipant Bar --latest main

  ##### Polling

  If the verification process takes a long time and there are results missing when the can-i-deploy command runs in your CI/CD pipeline, you can configure the
  command to poll and wait for the missing results to arrive. The arguments to specify are `--retry-while-unknown TIMES` and `--retry-interval SECONDS`, set to
  appropriate values for your pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

### SSL

To connect to a Pact Broker that uses custom SSL certificates, set the environment variable `$SSL_CERT_FILE` or `$SSL_CERT_DIR` to a path that contains the appropriate certificate.
